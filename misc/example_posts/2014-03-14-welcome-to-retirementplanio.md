Thanks for stopping by. This blog will be used to discuss topics around investing, ETFs, asset allocation, and retirement simulation. I will also throw in discussion around product development, feature requests and the like.

[Give us a shout](mailto:info@retirementplan.io?subject=Website Contact) if you have any ideas for the application, or would like more information. I'm always looking for features that would interest you.

If you have any questions around the methodology behind [RetirementPlan.io](http://www.retirementplan.io) let me know and I'll try to get a post up with more background and details.
